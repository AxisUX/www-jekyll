{% endhighlight %}



# Attempted Solutions:
- To no effect, On first attempt I used an upper-case `Author:` within the front-matter to declare the author attribute.  Front-matter requires lower-case 'author:'

# Additonal Notes:
- The conditional for whethor or not to include the author attribute is is found in the `post.html` layout in `.\_layouts\`.

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
    {%- if page.author -%}
        â€¢ <span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><span class="p-author h-card" itemprop="name">{{ page.author }}</span></span>
    {%- endif -%}</p>
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}
